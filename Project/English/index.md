2,domestic vacation destination 国内度假胜地

我们再来看看rival 的用法，rival 做名词表示 竞争对手比如

She has no rivals as a female rock singer.

她作为摇滚女歌手，没人可以与她匹敌。

have no rival 无以匹敌

此外，rival 经常可以做动词表示 比得上，是个及物动词。rival sth in sth 可以翻译成在...方面，与...相媲美。如果我们说 星巴克咖啡是最棒的，可以说

Starbucks coffee is the best. 或

No coffee can rival Starbucks.

“Get Back” provides both the standout moment and the title of a glorious new documentary by Peter Jackson, charting the days that the band spent together in January 1969, writing and recording songs for a new album.

句子主干“Get Back” provides both…and… 后面Charting…现在分词作非谓语因与其逻辑主语documentary之间为主谓关系，that引导定语从句修饰the day，writing and recording…与其逻辑主语the band之间也是主谓关系，故用现在分词作非谓语。

Few might have guessed that Guinea, a west African country of 13m people, played a big role in global commodity markets.

Guinea is only the latest factor behind the surging aluminium price. So far this year it has shot up by around 40%, faster than that of any other highly traded metal. One reason for the rally is growing demand. Locked-down consumers drank more at home, boosting demand for aluminium cans.

几内亚只是铝价飙升背后的最新影响因素。今年到目前为止，其价格已经飙升40%左右，增速比任何其他高交易量的金属都要快。其需求的增长是价格上涨的原因之一。由于受疫情封锁的消费者倾向于购买更多的饮品，这也推动了市场对铝罐的需求。

Whether the coup in Guinea will limit supply further is unclear. 

目前还无法确定几内亚的政变是否会进一步减少铝供应。

They have release some aluminium, along with other metals, from their strategic reserves to try to curb inflation.

他们已经从战略储备中释放了一些铝和其他金属，以试图遏制通胀。

This objective bumps up against others. One is the energy-consumption targets. Another is a limit on China’s aluminium output, setin 2017, when authorities thought the country was producing too much. If Chinese refineries start to restrict production as they approach the threshold, prices may rise until new capacity is built elsewhere.

这一目标与中国政府的环保目标发生冲突。一是能源消耗目标。另一个是中国在 2017 年设定了铝产量上限，当时当局认为中国的铝产量过高。如果中国的工厂在接近临界值时开始限制生产，那么价格可能会上升，直到其他地方建立新的产能。
